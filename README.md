# Fracture Detection in Musculoskeletal Radiographs using Transfer Learning and Neural Networks

## Project Overview:

This repository encompasses the research and implementation of fracture detection in musculoskeletal radiographs, specifically targeting 7 different body parts. Leveraging transfer learning and neural networks on the MURA dataset, the project aimed to enhance the accuracy of fracture detection in medical images.

## Key Achievements:

- Conducted research on fracture detection using transfer learning and neural networks.
  
- Applied Edge Detection and Image Sharpening Techniques to improve the base model's accuracy by 5%.

- Achieved an average Precision value of 84.55%.

- Outperformed Stanford ML Group's performance in the case of Fingers by 11%.
